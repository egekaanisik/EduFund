# EduFund
EduFund is a fundraiser app for schools and universities. It is made for Solution Challenge 2022.

## How to Run
You have to use Android Studio in order to run the app.

## Purpose
We have selected the Goal 4 of SDGs, and it is Quality Education. We based our solution on the target "By 2030, ensure equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university.". Some schools cannot afford some educational tools because of their price, and this makes an unbalanced environment between schools. With this project, we belive that schools can start a fundraiser to get their needs. For example, someone from USA can donate an amount of money to a school in Turkey so that this school can purchase technological tools. We aim to reduce the economical gap between schools so that everyone can be educated equally.
